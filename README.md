Notes


    Websockets are a powerful tool for real-time communication. We discussed how to use websockets to build applications that require real-time communication, such as chat applications.
    The community is growing rapidly, and with that comes new challenges. We discussed some of the issues that we are facing, such as how to best support new members.
    Learning curves can be steep, especially when it comes to new technologies. We discussed some tips for learning new things, such as finding a good mentor, breaking down complex tasks into smaller ones, and not being afraid to ask for help.
    There are many different ways to learn new things, the correct manner otherwise bad dev practices can lead to bugs, security vulnerabilities, and other problems. We discussed some of the most common bad dev practices, such as not writing a clear & clean code (PSR , DDD).
    Crowdsourcing can be a great way to solve common problems. We discussed how to create and manage crowdsourcing projects, and how to ensure that the results are accurate and reliable.
    Open sourcing is the practice of releasing software under an open-source license. We discussed the benefits of open sourcing, such as increased community involvement and improved security.
    Community help is essential for any successful project. We discussed how to get help from the community, such as asking questions on forums and mailing lists, and contributing to open source projects.
